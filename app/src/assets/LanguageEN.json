        "text3" :"Instead of putting the total number of verses in each sura after the sura, let us put it before the sura. So, the number representing sura 1 would look like this instead of 1234567 1 7: 7 1234567 1, and the number representing sura 2 would look like this instead of 12345.....284 285 286 2 286: 286 12345.... 284 285 286 2. This very long number representing the entire Quran is a multiple of 19."
